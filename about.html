        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="lead">Technology doesn’t have to feel intimidating — and asking for help shouldn’t feel embarrassing. <br>I’ve built my work around making technology understandable and approachable.</p>

        <div class="profile">
            <div>
                <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
                <p>I got my start in IT at the church I grew up in, thanks to the system administrator there, who became an early mentor. I was working as the receptionist when he “stole” me for IT — starting me off with my very first task: replacing hard drives — and gradually entrusted me with a wide range of responsibilities, from imaging computers and setting up switches to configuring an IP camera server and exploring ethical hacking in controlled environments. That early trust helped me develop confidence and problem-solving skills.</p>

                <h3>From Then Til Now</h3>
                <p>Since then, I’ve gained experience across a wide range of environments. I’ve completed successful internships with Oregon State University’s Open Source Lab and Intel, gained experience in remote helpdesk support, and provided volunteer tech help to individuals and organizations of all kinds. I hold formal training in front-end web development through the W3C CSS Basics certification, and have professional experience with back-end systems. I’m currently expanding my skills further by working on the Google IT Automation with Python Certificate and coursework toward the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certification, which focuses on ethical hacking and cybersecurity techniques.</p>

                <p>My background includes website development, programming, systems support, and general technology assistance. I hold an Associate of Science degree and have completed the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, supporting my work in IT and web development.</p>

                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p><b>What matters most to me isn’t a list of tools or titles — it’s how I work:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>clear, plain-language explanations</li>
                    <li>patience and respect</li>
                    <li>solutions that fit your needs and budget</li>
                    <li>meeting people where they are, technically and comfortably</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Whether I’m building a website, improving an existing system, helping with data, or answering a simple tech question, my goal is the same: to make technology easier to use and understand.
                <p>If you’re not sure how to describe your problem, that’s okay — I’m happy to talk it through.</p>
                <h3>Beyond Technology</h3>
                <p>When I’m not helping people with technology, I enjoy video games, Dungeons & Dragons, Pokémon, and spending time with my cat. I am also a published poet.</p>
